# Health-E-Connect
Software Engineering

our team came up with the idea of developing a web application that treats patients online. The goal is to provide accessible, convenient, cost-effective, and efficient healthcare services. To fulfill this, our team plans to include the following features in our application
• Book appointments with doctor
• Easy interaction between doctor and patient through video/audio
consultation.
• Prescription writing and generation
• Storing previous appointments and prescription records.
• Visualizing the number of consultations that happened in a period of time in various medical departments.
This application makes it easier for patients to contact doctors instantly and doctors can check patient’s previous appointments and health records online which will be never lost.
